## 📝 Abstract

This repository presents **Membership Inference Test (MINT)**, a new method for empirically assessing whether specific data was used in the training of AI/ML models. We introduce two MINT architectures based on **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, designed to learn the activation patterns that appear when an Audited Model is exposed to training data. The experiments focus on **Face Recognition**, using six public databases totaling over 22 million face images. Our MINT approach achieves up to **90% accuracy**, demonstrating its potential in determining if specific data was used for training. The method can be valuable for enhancing privacy and fairness in AI applications, such as detecting if sensitive data was used to train or fine-tune models like **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## DEMO

we present a MINT platform as demonstrator of this technology aimed to promote transparency in AI training. **[arXiv here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08332)**


This platform allows inference on the models presented in the following papers:**[arXiv here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08332)**, **[arXiv here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09225)**. This platform is focused on promoting transparency. We believe that a tool like this, which allows inference on MINT Models trained on various models (as many as possible, including image, text, video, etc.), would enable users to verify the proper use of their personal data across all models present on the platform and report cases where fundamental rights of citizens have been violated.

You can access the platform directly through the following **[link](https://ai-mintest.org/)**.
